Once a new level pack has been created you can then load it, and you will be in the level selector.
just press Y and start creating your own levels.
The level editor will know when a level has been changed, so it will ask you, if you want to save whenever you quit back to the level selector (using select).
The level editor will also automatically choose a filename for the levels, you don't need to worry about this.
Once your level pack is finished you can just zip your level pack directory and release it to the public. It is located in the home directory
Other people will then have to unzip your level pack in the level packs in the level pack directory from the home directory and it will be shown inside the game.
